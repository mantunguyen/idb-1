(R.A.M.). The events in Rage Against the Moons take place before those in Reborn on The Mars. The background is in the distant future, a post-apocalyptic world after the destruction brought about by Armageddon. The war between humans (Terran) and vampires (Methuselah) continues, as a struggle between two factions: the Vatican and the New Human Empire. Yet amidst the bloodshed and violence, many desire a peaceful co-existence between the two species. However, standing between them and this goal is the Rosenkreuz Orden, a group of vampire extremists who manipulate the two sides and pit them against each other. To combat them, the Vatican special operations group &quot;AX&quot;, led by Cardinal Caterina, must use everything they have - even a Crusnik (a vampire who preys on the blood of other vampires) to protect the peace effort.
