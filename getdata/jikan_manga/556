However, standing between them and this goal is the Rosenkreuz Orden, a group of vampire extremists who manipulate the two sides and pit them against each other. To combat them, the Vatican special operations group &quot;AX,&quot; led by Cardinal Caterina, must use everything they have\u2014even a vampire who preys on the blood of other vampires.
