problems. Moving to Tokyo, she&#039;s hoping to take control of her life and put all those messy misadventures behind her. She&#039;s looking for love and she&#039;s hoping to find it in the big city. Nana Osaki, on the other hand, is cool, confident and focused. She swaggers into town and proceeds to kick down the doors to Tokyo&#039;s underground punk scene. She&#039;s got a dream and won&#039;t give up until she becomes Japan&#039;s No. 1 rock&#039;n&#039;roll superstar. This is the story of two 20-year-old women who share the same name. Even though they come from completely different backgrounds, they somehow meet and become best friends. The world of Nana is a world exploding with sex, music, fashion, gossip and all-night parties.
