jikan_anime contains anime retrieved starting with id 1, running until we have 100 anime. This can be changed with num_items. It goes until anime id 120 because some ids don't exist.

jikan_manga contains about 40 manga that correspond to anime in jikan_anime. The other anime don't have corresponding manga, so we just chose additional manga starting from id 1 until we had 100.

jikan_character contains the first alphebetically listed main character in each anime. Only one character per show.

jikan_person contains the first alphebetically listed main character's Japanese voice actor in each anime. Only one person per show.
