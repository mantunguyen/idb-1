{"about": "A hotheaded 17-year-old high school student, and the protagonist of DearS. Takeya is unused to change, which makes his acceptance of the mysterious alien girl Ren all the more difficult (especially due to the fact that Neneko constantly showed him the Alien movies when they were children). But beneath his constant mask of indifference, he has a kind heart. Takeya tends to jump into things headfirst, and waste more time panicking about a problem than solving it. He also seems to lose his temper more often than he should, and as a result, has few close friends.\n\n", "name": "Takeya Ikuhara", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/3/54759.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/173815.jpg?s=673ae7af2c73648a0fe14b10883fff19", "link": "/manga/97/DearS", "name": "DearS"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/32575.jpg?s=d4f7f7f90b66fb68f62198424b94ddce", "link": "/manga/7459/DearS_Official_Fan_Book", "name": "DearS Official Fan Book"}], "member-favorites": 31, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/7/23426.jpg?s=1f3ea0021640f04385b98d8cbec9cff4", "link": "/anime/63/DearS", "name": "DearS"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/7/83451.jpg?s=4d991367bd6165b248308903e6813bdd", "link": "/anime/1817/DearS__Kin_no_Tama_desu_no", "name": "DearS: Kin no Tama desu no?"}], "name-japanese": "(\u3044\u304f\u306f\u3089\u305f\u3051\u3084)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/44594v.jpg", "link": "/people/196/Kishou_Taniyama", "name": "Taniyama, Kishou", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/48980v.jpg", "link": "/people/5118/Leonhard_Mahlich", "name": "Mahlich, Leonhard", "language": "German"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/40913v.jpg", "link": "/people/6358/Taliesin_Jaffe", "name": "Jaffe, Taliesin", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/questionmark_23.gif", "link": "/people/27875/Pascal_Grull", "name": "Grull, Pascal", "language": "French"}]}
