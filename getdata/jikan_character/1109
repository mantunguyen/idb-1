{"about": "Barasuishou is a doll created by Enju, Rozen's apprentice, who introduces herself as the seventh Rozen Maiden doll at the start of Rozen Maiden tr&auml;umend. This is a lie; she simply intends to dupe the other six Rozen Maiden into entering the Alice Game so that she may obtain their Rosae Mysticae and become the strongest doll.\n \n Barasuishou does eventually acquire the other six Rosae Mysticae, but cannot contain their power since she is not a true Rozen Maiden, and ends up shattering in Enju's arms. Barasuishou only appears in the tr&auml;umend anime.\n (Source: Wikipedia)\n\n", "name": "Barasuishou ", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/4/188354.jpg", "mangaography": [], "member-favorites": 94, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/4/10242.jpg?s=569b3ddc923bc9551843a1d445353f46", "link": "/anime/65/Rozen_Maiden__Tr\u00e4umend", "name": "Rozen Maiden: Tr\u00e4umend"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/1/1719.jpg?s=eb1faceb0bd7beff219f2d5b2258749c", "link": "/anime/1719/Rozen_Maiden__Ouvert\u00fcre", "name": "Rozen Maiden: Ouvert\u00fcre"}], "name-japanese": "(\u8594\u8587\u6c34\u6676)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/41617v.jpg", "link": "/people/211/Saori_Gotou", "name": "Gotou, Saori", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/36755v.jpg", "link": "/people/244/Tara_Platt", "name": "Platt, Tara", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/15407v.jpg", "link": "/people/14835/Hyeon_Jin_Lee", "name": "Lee, Hyeon Jin", "language": "Korean"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/questionmark_23.gif", "link": "/people/26601/Alexandra_Correa", "name": "Correa, Alexandra", "language": "French"}]}
