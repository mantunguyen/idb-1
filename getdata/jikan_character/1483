{"about": "Birthday: July 30 \n Height: 160cm \n \n Lisianthus Eustoma, or Sia for short, is one of the main characters in Navel's Shuffle! media franchise. She is the princess of the god world and came to the human world as a possible marriage candidate for Rin Tsuchimi. \n \n Lisianthus is the only daughter of Eustoma and Cineraria, making her actually half-god, half-devil, but she only inherited the god racial characteristics of her father. Through Cineraria, she is Forbesii's niece and Nerine's cousin. She is also the non-biological daughter of Iris and Liliac, as Eustoma practices polygamy. Despite her fondness for her father, Lisianthus has a habit of hitting him with a folding chair, in a fashion similar to WWE, if he embarrasses her in front of her friends. \n \n Sia was to be born with a twin, Kikyou, but while still in their mother's womb it was fated that Kikyou would not survive. Determined to save her, Sia absorbed Kikyou's soul into her own body. But due to this Sia has a dissociative identity disorder, and Kikyou's personality sometime emerges. \n Lisianthus is named after the Eustoma russellianum, or Bolero Deep Blue, of what used to be known as the Lisianthus genus. In hanakotoba, (the Japanese language of flowers), this flower has connotations of \"hope\", \"wish\", or \"aspiration\". \n \n (Source: Wikipedia) \n\n", "name": "Lisianthus Eustoma", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/7/50897.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/157292.jpg?s=beede378142dc1d1eae9d12789b3daed", "link": "/manga/1788/Shuffle", "name": "Shuffle!"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/7984.jpg?s=4b1aa1b6bbc0ffbd2efc2d2aeb757c4d", "link": "/manga/6234/Shuffle__Tick_Tack", "name": "Shuffle: Tick!
