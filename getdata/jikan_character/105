Calm, cool, and detached, he seldom speaks and never smiles. Trowa falls in with a traveling circus troupe as cover for his terrorist mission, finding employment as the world's most dispassionate clown. Trowa is a gifted and fearless acrobat, and these abilities also prove useful in his alternate occupation as a Gundam pilot.\n \n Despite his youth, Trowa is an experienced professional soldier. His preferred combat tactic is to stand his ground and spray the battlefield with an endless hail of bullets, though every now and then he'll dispatch an enemy with his acrobatic trademark move - a mid-air triple spin, ending in a deadly knife slash.\n \n His real name, according to the Gundam Wing prequel Manga: Episode Zero, is Triton Bloom, Catherine Bloom's long lost Brother.\n \n In Frozen Teardrop\n In MC0021, alongside Instructor W, Trowa (under the alias \"Dokter T\") develops 4 new mobile suits for unknown purposes. When asked by his young look-alike Trowa Phobos  what the T in his name stands for, he first answers 'Trowa', but later concedes that it stands for 'Triton', confirming other series materials which indicate that Trowa is Catherine Bloom's long-lost brother.\n\n", "name": "Trowa Barton", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/15/40382.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/6310.jpg?s=8f3e02ddecdc7b9109a452a1bb0e53c3", "link": "/manga/349/Shin_Kidou_Senki_Gundam_Wing", "name": "Shin Kidou Senki Gundam Wing"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/5/126995.jpg?s=03caf74dde1b8624b8582e8c1b1d263f", "link": "/manga/1546/Shin_Kidou_Senki_Gundam_Wing__Episode_Zero", "name": "Shin Kidou Senki Gundam Wing: Episode Zero"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/131547.jpg?s=e12723185c442455d9182656b73c7644", "link": "/manga/1936/Shin_Kidou_Senki_Gundam_Wing__Endless_Waltz", "name": "Shin Kidou Senki Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/3529.jpg?s=04d7b8c9c000d8f5b7547c460ebbdc2f", "link": "/manga/1938/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_Wing__Battlefield_of_Pacifists", "name": "Mobile Suit Gundam Wing: Battlefield of Pacifists"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/6195.jpg?s=20123f2cda29aad2299dd4e1b6738029", "link": "/manga/1939/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_Wing__Blind_Target", "name": "Mobile Suit Gundam Wing: Blind Target"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/126997.jpg?s=a67e67c865baa059bf839211be42b9c8", "link": "/manga/1941/Shin_Kidou_Senki_Gundam_Wing__Ground_Zero", "name": "Shin Kidou Senki Gundam Wing: Ground Zero"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/147435.jpg?s=5cf1123a671f717972f3fb641d070da9", "link": "/manga/25822/Shin_Kidou_Senki_Gundam_Wing__Frozen_Teardrop", "name": "Shin Kidou Senki Gundam Wing: Frozen Teardrop"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/160508.jpg?s=f6acee579e3043d5e5de4e4cbbcd421e", "link": "/manga/91443/Shin_Kidou_Senki_Gundam_Wing", "name": "Shin Kidou Senki Gundam Wing"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/160509.jpg?s=5a995c047bd419c97633fd089c538898", "link": "/manga/91444/Shin_Kidou_Senki_Gundam_Wing__Endless_Waltz", "name": "Shin Kidou Senki Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz"}], "member-favorites": 237, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/11/6613.jpg?s=03588b3a15eac017ee5f6e41080af924", "link": "/anime/90/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_Wing", "name": "Mobile Suit Gundam Wing"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/1/91.jpg?s=790c4a47adda06f79af904f9e4aa0a77", "link": "/anime/91/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_Wing__Endless_Waltz", "name": "Mobile Suit Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/1/2507.jpg?s=9bfb0752616edf25adb0a7d0e011f359", "link": "/anime/2273/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_Wing__Endless_Waltz_Movie", "name": "Mobile Suit Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz Movie"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/2/42885.jpg?s=82f3ff697f50ca8faac464903f6dae00", "link": "/anime/3626/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_Wing__Operation_Meteor", "name": "Mobile Suit Gundam Wing: Operation Meteor"}], "name-japanese": "(\u30c8\u30ed\u30ef\u30fb\u30d0\u30fc\u30c8\u30f3)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/39581v.jpg", "link": "/people/307/Kirby_Morrow", "name": "Morrow, Kirby", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/5698v.jpg", "link": "/people/445/Shigeru_Nakahara", "name": "Nakahara, Shigeru", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/1280v.jpg", "link": "/people/1286/Massimo_Di_benedetto", "name": "Di benedetto, Massimo", "language": "Italian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/34185v.jpg", "link": "/people/1830/Wendel_Bezerra", "name": "Bezerra, Wendel", "language": "Brazilian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/questionmark_23.gif", "link": "/people/42632/Stefano_Billi", "name": "Billi, Stefano", "language": "Italian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/46545v.jpg", "link": "/people/43050/Rasmus_Borowski", "name": "Borowski, Rasmus", "language": "German"}]}
