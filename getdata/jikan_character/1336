During his first battle at Loum, Char was able to destroy five Federation Salamis-class ships on his own. He was given the title of \"Red Comet\" for his fast movements and his red colored Zaku II. Char&#039;s true intentions were to kill all the Zabi family members for killing his father the original Zeon leader, Zeon Zum Deikun.\n \n Char had been following the White Base crew throughout the One Year War, U.C. 0079. He met with Amuro several times and engaged in many of the most epic battles in Mobile Suit warfare history.\n \n During the One Year War, Char used plenty of Mobile Suits, only 1 was not colored Red. The MS&#039;s he used were (in this order): Zaku II, Z&#039;Gok, Gelgoog, and the Zeong. In the novels, he also use a red Rick Dom.\n After the War between the Zeon and the Federation, Char joined the AEUG, under the name Quattro Bajeena, to help them liberate the oppressed colonies from the hands of the Titans. In the AEUG he was an instructor, commander, and later leader of the AEUG after the assassination of the former leader. His mobile suits during his time as Lieutenant Quattro was the psuedo Gundam, Hyaku Shiki, and before that, the Rick Dias (painted red).\n \n Char then takes command of the remaining Zeon remnants reforming them into the Newborn Neo Zeon to take his father&#039;s place and finish what his father had started. In this phase of his life he piloted the newtype-specialist mobile suit Sazabi (and in the novel, the Nightingale), which returns to the red colour scheme he is famous for.\n (Source: Gundam Wikia)\n\n", "name": "Char Aznable", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/8/81955.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/6308.jpg?s=c887630183317b9b210194c695c128ad", "link": "/manga/206/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam_0079", "name": "Kidou Senshi Gundam 0079"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/151300.jpg?s=351a873bd078e25b7f789eb5a9ff36a7", "link": "/manga/214/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam__The_Origin", "name": "Kidou Senshi Gundam: The Origin"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/10596.jpg?s=b650e08f9cf391ee9902895400e02fcf", "link": "/manga/7768/Gaia_Gear", "name": "Gaia Gear"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/4/12944.jpg?s=c0d2d1b8d7b2e8ca5ff9e25557067db7", "link": "/manga/9142/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam__CDA_-_Wakaki_Suisei_no_Shouzou", "name": "Kidou Senshi Gundam: C.D.A. - Wakaki Suisei no Shouzou"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/148093.jpg?s=54e4740a3c3c43651e661354ef0134f0", "link": "/manga/9736/Kidou_Senshi_Z_Gundam", "name": "Kidou Senshi Z Gundam"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/148121.jpg?s=ace3b2581ee4cc1e775ed61efac97f65", "link": "/manga/9889/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam", "name": "Kidou Senshi Gundam"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/40572.jpg?s=afcf4f28732e74266cb8fbc61de63781", "link": "/manga/15018/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam-san", "name": "Kidou Senshi Gundam-san"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/113425.jpg?s=89fc20c8983ea20a9831a28776b66bc7", "link": "/manga/20423/Mobile_Suit_Gundam__Chars_Counterattack_-_Beyond_the_Time", "name": "Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack - Beyond the Time"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/148281.jpg?s=a2d0bb92c6cb9a2024dcdae1bf6c4705", "link": "/manga/29391/Kidou_Senshi_Z_Gundam_Define", "name": "Kidou Senshi Z Gundam Define"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/148119.jpg?s=bc17f789991014124638b3588429c80f", "link": "/manga/30593/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam__Gyakushuu_no_Char_-_Beltorchikas_Children", "name": "Kidou Senshi Gundam: Gyakushuu no Char - Beltorchika's Children"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/120465.jpg?s=a39d6060d41741f9f9b4dbb633952499", "link": "/manga/70331/Char_no_Nichijou", "name": "Char no Nichijou"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/4/146717.jpg?s=3b01f51eaf793b637ddf0d22f8fe5336", "link": "/manga/72431/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam__Gyakushuu_no_Char_-_Beltorchikas_Children", "name": "Kidou Senshi Gundam: Gyakushuu no Char - Beltorchika's Children"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/141293.jpg?s=bdb4a7fd3090e429e087279cf98ea62a", "link": "/manga/81643/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam_UC_Senki__Tsuioku_no_Char_Aznable", "name": "Kidou Senshi Gundam U.C.
