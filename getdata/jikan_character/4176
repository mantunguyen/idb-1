{"about": "Shamal, being Yuuno&#039;s counterpart, does not actually fight, but uses her ring devices to defend, create portals, absorb victims&#039; Linker Cores into the Book of Darkness, and the like. Shamal acts as the &#039;mother&#039; of the group, doing the shopping, worrying excessively over the others&#039; well-being, and constructing excuses to Hayate as to why they&#039;re out so often (\"The grocery store doesn&#039;t have our brand of olive oil\"). She knows that Hayate does not want them to fight anyone for her, but it is still no question that they must. In StrikerS, she is a soft-spoken member of the Wolkenritter that specializes in defense and healing. She is a medical officer. \n\n", "name": "Shamal ", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/13/226523.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/30379.jpg?s=7ed8f80b53957f3e43ea5621589f19ea", "link": "/manga/1231/Mahou_Shoujo_Lyrical_Nanoha_StrikerS_THE_COMICS", "name": "Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS THE COMICS"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/33371.jpg?s=3cf84b07307ec9b7920518bc0d01cdda", "link": "/manga/3236/Mahou_Shoujo_Lyrical_Nanoha_As", "name": "Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha A's"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/27278.jpg?s=517c1f9f6b48bb340bfa7357840b172f", "link": "/manga/13268/Mahou_Senki_Lyrical_Nanoha_Force", "name": "Mahou Senki Lyrical Nanoha Force"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/5/27365.jpg?s=d389ab709e806b0248cd255267082934", "link": "/manga/14238/Mahou_Shoujo_Lyrical_Nanoha_ViVid", "name": "Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha ViVid"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/5/71079.jpg?s=0fc2a1dd9c4e9fedb0c8f0145586851f", "link": "/manga/34299/Mahou_Shoujo_Lyrical_Nanoha_As_Portable__The_Gears_of_Destiny_-_Material_Musume", "name": "Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha A's Portable: The Gears of Destiny - Material Musume."}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/100787.jpg?s=ed32d248e5a98a7ab5ecbb9cfb810fe9", "link": "/manga/42129/Mahou_Shoujo_Lyrical_Nanoha_Innocent", "name": "Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha Innocent"}], "member-favorites": 10, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/4/6767.jpg?s=61c04ef360484caac42b3bb2ed0111fe", "link": "/anime/77/Mahou_Shoujo_Lyrical_Nanoha_As", "name": "Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha A's"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/3/14190.jpg?s=68b6dd368fdb758322a277027dfe9dec", "link": "/anime/1915/Mahou_Shoujo_Lyrical_Nanoha_StrikerS", "name": "Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/13/35733.jpg?s=676cc6d4d769c83171f5081962c33bb3", "link": "/anime/10153/Mahou_Shoujo_Lyrical_Nanoha__The_Movie_2nd_As", "name": "Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha: The Movie 2nd A's"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/11/88348.jpg?s=12ee1de47d83186ddb15fcff3da0f390", "link": "/anime/17947/Mahou_Shoujo_Lyrical_Nanoha__Reflection", "name": "Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha: Reflection"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/72718.jpg?s=5e4c1aed0f4c9e4808e5f43549f1a8eb", "link": "/anime/25939/Mahou_Shoujo_Lyrical_Nanoha_ViVid", "name": "Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha ViVid"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/13/86963.jpg?s=420b692e2e7627285f58a2d65185b567", "link": "/anime/35984/Mahou_Shoujo_Lyrical_Nanoha__Detonation", "name": "Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha: Detonation"}], "name-japanese": "(\u30b7\u30e3\u30de\u30eb)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/23303v.jpg", "link": "/people/141/Ryouka_Yuzuki", "name": "Yuzuki, Ryouka", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/13027v.jpg", "link": "/people/11370/Shelby_Lindley", "name": "Lindley, Shelby", "language": "English"}]}
