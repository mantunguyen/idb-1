She was kidnapped by the Newtype Jamil Neate. She later was rescued by Garrod Ran, who was hired by her original kidnappers. As they were pursued, Garrod became astonished by her Newtype abilities. (from Gundam X Arena and Japanese Official Website)\n \n Born after the end of the 7th Space War she was taken by the Alternative Company to be studied so that they can understand the power of Newtype&#039;s and use their power to become the most powerful post-war corperation in the world. \n Tiffa was rescued by Jamil Neate, the captain of the Vulture land warship Freeden, and kept on the ship as it made its escape. As she stayed on the ship, Garrod Ran comes to rescue her as part of a mission given to him by men secretly working for the Alternative Company. Tiffa goes with him willingly, guiding him to an abandoned United Nations Earth factory where a GX-9900 Gundam X was left, helping Garrod to access the powerful Satellite Cannon of the Gundam to defeat a number of Vulture&#039;s after the machine.
