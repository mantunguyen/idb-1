{"about": "In My Otome, Mashiro Blan de Windbloom is the princess (and later Queen) of Windbloom. Her personality is completely opposite to her My-HiME incarnation. Rather than the polite, selfless and reserved attitude of the former, Mashiro Blan de Windbloom is boisterous, selfish, and arrogant. There are doubts on whether she is the true ruler - doubts which prove correct when the true ruler of Windbloom is discovered by Sergay W&aacute;ng. Mikoto the cat is her pet. She has a love-hate relationship with Nagi, leaning more towards the &#039;hate&#039; end of the spectrum. It was never made clear in My-Hime what her true age was but in My-Otome it is explicitly said that she is 14-years-old and later turns 15.\n \n She first met Nina and Arika when she was evading her palace guards by attempting to jump to the next building&#039;s roof.

As Sergay W&aacute;ng noted, the city was suffering from increasing unemployment. Small glimpses of her past revealed that when Mashiro was young, she was completely spoiled as a child, being given virtually anything she wanted on demand. When she overheard some of the rumors that she was not the true princess, Mashiro&#039;s behavior worsened due to her highly increased feelings of insecurity and inadequacy.\n \n During an emergency, she formed a contract with Arika to save their lives. Unfortunately for the two, the search for ways to break the contract yielded no answers. While Mashiro and Arika were initially very opposed to their contract, its life-binding conditions actually created a break in the tension between them, and they slowly began to \n\n", "name": "Mashiro Blan de Windbloom", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/13/36785.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/648.jpg?s=60f56d442477f108aabfaa5c2218a541", "link": "/manga/1069/Mai-Otome", "name": "Mai-Otome"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/5708.jpg?s=5d18e7c45555b9dc36a4ab2086831fbb", "link": "/manga/1254/Mai-Otome_Arashi", "name": "Mai-Otome Arashi"}], "member-favorites": 14, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/2/46897.jpg?s=e23a53ae516c9f7ca91e7909336776bb", "link": "/anime/99/Mai-Otome", "name": "Mai-Otome"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/8/7222.jpg?s=b69810a5a27b7e8b5ea5fdc92ecf6dc7", "link": "/anime/1609/Mai-Otome_Zwei", "name": "Mai-Otome Zwei"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/3/27410.jpg?s=a475bf0d9f9e3d6286a72be2912bd4f8", "link": "/anime/1659/Mai-Otome_Specials", "name": "Mai-Otome Specials"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/6/23015.jpg?s=b8757b92dc85b7ff3f3d6a784c826c72", "link": "/anime/8518/Mai-Otome_Special__Otome_no_Inori", "name": "Mai-Otome Special: Otome no Inori"}], "name-japanese": "(\u98a8\u82b1 \u771f\u767d / \u30de\u30b7\u30ed\u30fb\u30d6\u30e9\u30f3\u30fb\u30c9\u30fb\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30c8\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30e0)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/45746v.jpg", "link": "/people/140/Yukana", "name": "Yukana", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/questionmark_23.gif", "link": "/people/789/Katie_Rowan", "name": "Rowan, Katie", "language": "English"}]}
