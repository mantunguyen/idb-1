{"about": "The sixth doll, and the very embodiment of childishness. Although she can be ridiculously na&iuml;ve and selfish, she has nothing but the best intentions for those that she cares about. Her disposition is also a mismatch for her power, which is a series of attacks based on strawberry vines, which she mostly uses to restrain opponents. She is beaten by Shinku in the Alice Game, becoming the first doll to lose the ability to become Alice. Shinku does not beat Hinaichigo outright; the younger doll simply exhausted the energy of her medium, Tomoe. Shinku then warned Hinaichigo that continuing the fight would kill Tomoe, whereupon Hinaichigo renounced the tie that made Tomoe her medium. Despite being the victor, Shinku does not take Hinaichigo&#039;s Rosa Mystica. Instead, Shinku lets herself be an inter-medium so that Hinaichigo can tap into Jun&#039;s energy. In the latter half of Rozen Maiden tr&auml;umend, with the Alice Game apparently having begun in earnest, \"Father\" cuts off this link, so when Hinaichigo uses up what little energy she has, she loses her Rosa Mystica to Shinku. She is the second doll to lose her Rosa Mystica.\n \n In the manga, Hinaichigo is taken from Jun after Odille Fosset, granddaughter of a previous owner of Hinaichigo, arrives at the Sakurada home and displays a ring, apparently from Hinaichigo, on her finger. Though Jun tells Hinaichigo that she may choose who to stay with, Hinaichigo apparently does not consciously decide to go with Odille; after awakening from sleep, Hinaichigo is confused to find herself in Odille&#039;s room, which she recognizes as that of Odille&#039;s grandmother, Corinne. Shortly afterwards, Hinaichigo is destroyed in quite disturbing fashion by Kirakishou; after telling her to say goodbye to everyone, Kirakishou uses her rose vines to consume Hinaichigo from the inside out. Hinaichigo sends her Rosa Mystica to Shinku through Berrybell, her artificial spirit, asking Shinku to use the Rosa Mystica to end the Alice Game.\n \n Hinaichigo&#039;s favorite foods are strawberry daifuku, which she calls \"unyuu,\" and Nori&#039;s \"Hanamaru Hamburger,\" which is a hamburger patty topped with a fried egg in the shape of a flower. She adores the puppet detective Kun Kun, though her fandom is not as avid as Shinku&#039;s. She also loves to draw, as shown often in both seasons of the anime and the OVA. She usually ends her sentences in \"na no\" (meaning \"that&#039;s why\" or \"because\" in Japanese), complimentary to Kanaria&#039;s \"kashira\" (meaning \"I wonder\" or \"maybe?\").\n \n In the anime, Hinaichigo&#039;s singing and her arguments with Suiseiseki are actually ad-libbed by her seiyuus. \n \n Medium: Tomoe (First Season)/Jun (Indirectly)\n Artificial Spirit: Berrybell\n \n Hinaichigo&#039;s name in English means, \"Petite Strawberry.\"\n\n", "name": "Hina Ichigo ", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/7/100622.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/169707.jpg?s=b6da1c07cdba328c908acb8215d307d2", "link": "/manga/98/Rozen_Maiden", "name": "Rozen Maiden"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/113855.jpg?s=36357972a8a4eb8d8e0e847ddce51dc8", "link": "/manga/7728/Rozen_Maiden_2008", "name": "Rozen Maiden (2008)"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/119911.jpg?s=60106834f657e8fffba5d51592237b3e", "link": "/manga/31373/Rozen_Maiden__Dolls_Talk", "name": "Rozen Maiden: Dolls Talk"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/187214.jpg?s=77e07b306a1c1867aa39fb2f40294ee9", "link": "/manga/95216/Rozen_Maiden_Zero", "name": "Rozen Maiden Zero"}], "member-favorites": 270, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/2/15728.jpg?s=d32a7a33685bdc5e759b42cadc59cdd2", "link": "/anime/64/Rozen_Maiden", "name": "Rozen Maiden"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/4/10242.jpg?s=569b3ddc923bc9551843a1d445353f46", "link": "/anime/65/Rozen_Maiden__Tr\u00e4umend", "name": "Rozen Maiden: Tr\u00e4umend"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/1/1719.jpg?s=eb1faceb0bd7beff219f2d5b2258749c", "link": "/anime/1719/Rozen_Maiden__Ouvert\u00fcre", "name": "Rozen Maiden: Ouvert\u00fcre"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/10/52079.jpg?s=dff6fc156fa86b2d34d34b073162bbab", "link": "/anime/18041/Rozen_Maiden_2013", "name": "Rozen Maiden (2013)"}], "name-japanese": "(\u96db\u82fa)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/41024v.jpg", "link": "/people/151/Hilary_Haag", "name": "Haag, Hilary", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/41419v.jpg", "link": "/people/163/Sherry_Lynn", "name": "Lynn, Sherry", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/10097v.jpg", "link": "/people/204/Sakura_Nogawa", "name": "Nogawa, Sakura", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/15841v.jpg", "link": "/people/788/Yong_Sin_Lee", "name": "Lee, Yong Sin", "language": "Korean"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/5197v.jpg", "link": "/people/6106/Rubina_Kuraoka", "name": "Kuraoka, Rubina", "language": "German"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/questionmark_23.gif", "link": "/people/7283/Beatrice_Wegnez", "name": "Wegnez, Beatrice", "language": "French"}]}
