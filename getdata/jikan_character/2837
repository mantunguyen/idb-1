{"about": "A mute with a nearly uncanny resemblance to Freddie Mercury. Hayashida claimed that as long as he attended, Cromartie would be the \"Olympics for delinquents\". Although he never speaks and people assume he is a mute, Freddie actually has a good singing voice and the only occasion people can hear his voice is when he sings. He also rides a horse to school, and seems to be in Japan for no apparent reason.\n\nNo voice actors have been added to this character.
