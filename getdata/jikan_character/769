{"about": "Amy is a Computer/Techno whiz. She was saved and recruited by Sei after Amy&#039;s hacking drew attention to the authorities. She often argues with Meg and also loves scarfing down Kyohei&#039;s various treats. She has a cult following in the cyberworld. She is often seen carrying what appears to be a pink stuffed animal that actually contains a laptop.
