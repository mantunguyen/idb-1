{"about": "Genetic Type: Coordinator\n Birthday: September 1, CE 57\n Birthplace: ORB \n Age: GSD16, GSMovie18\n Blood-type: O \n Height: 168cm, 173cm\n Weight: 55kg \n Memorable Belongings: His deceased younger sister Mayu&#039;s cell phone \n Mobile Suit: ZGMF-X56S Impulse Gundam, ZGMF-X42S Destiny Gundam\n \n Shinn is the first protagonist introduced, but later conflict pits him against the established protagonists of the original Mobile Suit Gundam SEED. Thus, he serves in both the \"hero\" and \"villain\" roles at different points of the story.\n \n Shinn lives with his parents and his younger sister in the neutral country of Orb, but the Earth Alliance attacks Orb on June 15. Only Shinn survives when his family is caught in a crossfire between the GAT-X131 Calamity and the ZGMF-X10A Freedom mobile suits, though it is not clear whether the Calamity or the Freedom was responsible for the explosion that kills Shinn&#039;s family. Shinn blames Orb&rsquo;s rulers, the Athhas, for his family&rsquo;s deaths, believing that they should have surrendered to the attacking Earth Alliance Forces rather than endangering civilians in a battle that could not be won. Since then, he had a lust for revenge and hated ORB and their \"sugarcoated\" ideals of achieving peace without any weapons, etc.  Orb soldier Captain Todaka then takes care of Shinn and later sends him to the PLANTs, where he joins ZAFT and graduates as one of the top students in his class as a \"ZAFT Red\".\n \n After graduation, Shinn is assigned to pilot ZAFT&#039;s ZGMF-X56S Impulse, and is stationed aboard the battleship Minerva under the command of Talia Gladys along with former military academy classmates Rey Za Burrel, Vino Dupre, Lunamaria Hawke, Meyrin Hawke, and Yolant Kent. Even though the bitter end of his family happened in the past, he has never forgotten it and constantly has reoccuring flashbacks of that time including the good memories he has of his sister.\n\n", "name": "Shinn Asuka", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/13/72918.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/6192.jpg?s=0088827d17f562a8b297b4fd8f828571", "link": "/manga/4981/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_SEED_Destiny__The_Edge_Desire", "name": "Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny: The Edge Desire"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/19530.jpg?s=f6c356a70ff4fe3d3392c8ff02dce0af", "link": "/manga/13787/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_SEED_Destiny__The_Edge", "name": "Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny: The Edge"}], "member-favorites": 246, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/4/80485.jpg?s=75cadf39cc42e39e3cbdeca6c806df18", "link": "/anime/94/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_Seed_Destiny", "name": "Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/53331.jpg?s=6f5e754b18c0da85745df399eeb4ef2d", "link": "/anime/1241/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_Seed_Destiny_Final_Plus__The_Chosen_Future", "name": "Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny Final Plus: The Chosen Future"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/2/18686.jpg?s=8daafaf00bb0a4c566a9faf53d3d0548", "link": "/anime/2294/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_Seed_Destiny_Special_Edition", "name": "Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny Special Edition"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/3/52119.jpg?s=a8d303e7f0641ba14145b7603e9dfdac", "link": "/anime/2743/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_Seed__Seed_Supernova_-_Tanekyara_Gekijou", "name": "Mobile Suit Gundam Seed: Seed Supernova - Tanekyara Gekijou"}], "name-japanese": "(\u30b7\u30f3\u30fb\u30a2\u30b9\u30ab)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/42208v.jpg", "link": "/people/5/Kenichi_Suzumura", "name": "Suzumura, Kenichi", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/41706v.jpg", "link": "/people/813/Matthew_Erickson", "name": "Erickson, Matthew", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/34743v.jpg", "link": "/people/33725/Taric_Mehani", "name": "Mehani, Taric", "language": "French"}]}
