{"about": "Kippei is quite the easygoing type and had no idea what hit him when he was told to start taking care of Yuzuyu. At his first attempt to make Yuzuyu&#039;s lunch he only made an onigiri; an extra large one, but Yuzuyu eats it because Kippei is the one who cooked it. Over the series his cooking and personality change. He becomes a little more responsible and gains a girlfriend named Kokoro. Kippei tends to be quite flirty and isn&#039;t very smart. He is very kind and loving.\n\n", "name": "Kippei Katakura", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/7/30965.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/166559.jpg?s=814d2c61bb2c2c36b05872406376147f", "link": "/manga/55/Aishiteruze_Baby\u2605\u2605", "name": "Aishiteruze Baby\u2605\u2605"}], "member-favorites": 122, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/2/69665.jpg?s=7dabfb9b86ae20607c63b89002ecd030", "link": "/anime/102/Aishiteruze_Baby\u2605\u2605", "name": "Aishiteruze Baby\u2605\u2605"}], "name-japanese": "(\u7247\u5009\u7d50\u5e73)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/5764v.jpg", "link": "/people/922/Daisuke_Fujita", "name": "Fujita, Daisuke", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/20203v.jpg", "link": "/people/9932/Aur\u00e9lien_Ringelheim", "name": "Ringelheim, Aur\u00e9lien", "language": "French"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/15343v.jpg", "link": "/people/14757/Won_Hyeong_Choi", "name": "Choi, Won Hyeong", "language": "Korean"}]}
