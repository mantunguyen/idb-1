{"about": "Main vocalist for BECK, he is the key member that Ryusuke needed to bring Taira into the band. His attitude, style, and appearance was based on Zack De La Rocha from Rage Against The Machine and compared to Koyuki, his voice is more punk and rock oriented, like the majority of the band&#039;s songs. He also named the band \"Beck\" after staring at Ryusuke&#039;s dog for a few moments. He also tends to pick his nose.\n\n", "name": "Tsunemi Chiba", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/10/90978.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/171795.jpg?s=2a3f2457e3ed36d11b375913c84f1264", "link": "/manga/145/Beck", "name": "Beck"}], "member-favorites": 289, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/11/11636.jpg?s=8b19d94199584ce32eba8ab47081ff5a", "link": "/anime/57/Beck", "name": "Beck"}], "name-japanese": "(\u5343\u8449 \u6052\u7f8e)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/12472v.jpg", "link": "/people/203/Justin_Cook", "name": "Cook, Justin", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/1654v.jpg", "link": "/people/1818/Shintarou_Oohata", "name": "Oohata, Shintarou", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/questionmark_23.gif", "link": "/people/26869/Gwen_Lebret", "name": "Lebret, Gwen", "language": "French"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/37203v.jpg", "link": "/people/35543/Luca_Ghignone", "name": "Ghignone, Luca", "language": "Italian"}]}
